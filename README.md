# Block Encrypter Description

Block Encrypter is designed to make encrypting data in .NET / C# easier. 

The way in which this library goes about encryption has been peer reviewed by many people in the open source community so you should feel rest assured it is a secure way to encrypt data using standard cryptographic primitives like AES, HMAC, PBKDF, and cryptographically secure random number generation.
